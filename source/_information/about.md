I'm a passionate programmer with a keen interest in software development, robotics, and artificial intelligence. 
Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering, 
University of Porto, I strive to excel in both academic endeavors and personal projects.

My academic journey has exposed me to various programming languages and technologies, 
allowing me to build a diverse skill set that spans from web development to systems programming. 
With each project I undertake, I aim to push my boundaries and explore new technologies.

Beyond coding, I value teamwork, problem-solving, and continuous learning. 
These principles guide my approach to both academic and professional environments, 
helping me deliver high-quality results and maintain effective collaboration.
