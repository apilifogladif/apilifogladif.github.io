I'm a passionate programmer with a strong interest in software development, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Currently, I work as an AI Developer Analyst at UPGRAIDE, where I contribute to the creation of innovative AI solutions that enhance user experiences and optimize processes.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering from the University of Porto, which provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and practical programming skills. I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, allowing me to explore advanced topics such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision in greater depth.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've gained hands-on experience with a wide range of programming languages and technologies, developing a versatile skill set that spans web development, systems programming, and AI integration. I continuously seek out challenging projects that push my boundaries and encourage me to explore new tools and approaches.

Beyond technical skills, I place a high value on teamwork, creative problem-solving, and lifelong learning. These core principles shape my work ethic and help me deliver high-quality solutions while fostering strong collaboration in both academic and professional settings.
